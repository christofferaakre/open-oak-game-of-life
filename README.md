# open-oak-game-of-life
`open-oak-game-of-life` is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life
(See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using
[conlife](https://github.com/christofferaakre/conlife) as the backend,
and [open-oak](https://github.com/christofferaakre/open-oak) to render the front-end.

You provide the width and height of the grid, as well as the starting configuration,
and it will open a window and run the simulation in real-time. The window can be closed
by pressing Escape.
